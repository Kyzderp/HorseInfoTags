# HorseInfoTags
Simple plugin that displays horse information in nametag and chat

HorseInfoTags is a simple plugin that displays configurable horse/donkey/mule stat info above their head and in your chat when you right click on a horse with an empty hand, depending on the settings you have chosen. It also adds a configurable "rating" system for players to decide whether a horse is good or bad with a quick glance.
